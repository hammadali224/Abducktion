# Abducktion
A 2D platformer made in Unreal Engine 4. The game is about a duck that has been ab-duck-ted (get it) and must go through all the obstacles in its path to head back home. There are potions that can change the duck's power, positively or negatively. Eat bread to restore some health. Shoot feathers to attack enemies and avoid obstacles to make it to the end.
